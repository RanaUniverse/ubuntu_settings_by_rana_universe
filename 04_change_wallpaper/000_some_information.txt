The Two image file need to be kept in the ~/.local/share/backgrounds folder, and in the dconf i need to use this, 


All the things are kept in the 1.bkup file which i got from (dcon dump / > 1.bkup)



To Manually Change The Picture Size i need to run like this, 

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-options 'scaled'
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-options centered


(scaled value is good with show full image in the screen)

Some Other Values are: 

(gsettings range org.gnome.desktop.background picture-options)

'none'
'wallpaper'
'centered'
'scaled'
'stretched'
'zoom'
'spanned'
