This two package help me to install the Extension Manager app in my laptop, for this i used a command to first get the link of the packages and its necessary packages, and then use the packages_list.txt to download the .deb files.



    sudo apt-get install --print-uris --yes package_name | grep ^\' | cut -d\' -f2 > z_packages_list.txt

    wget -i z_packages_list.txt
