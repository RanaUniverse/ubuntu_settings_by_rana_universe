Here when i install a extensions in the gnome extension manger app this just got saved inside the below folder: 

	~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/package_folder_name

for each extensions i download it got saved in this extensions directory with different name.

This only include the file not the settings of this.


The settings got saved in somewhere to get this i can use dconf dump / > file.txt, from where i can see the settings individually or i need to export in each of the extesnion page in the extension manager application.
