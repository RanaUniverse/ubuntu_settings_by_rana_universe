Here when i install a extensions in the gnome extension manger app this just got saved inside the below folder: 

	~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/package_folder_name

for each extensions i download it got saved in this extensions directory with different name.

This only include the file not the settings of this.


The settings got saved in somewhere to get this i can use dconf dump / > file.txt, from where i can see the settings individually or i need to export in each of the extesnion page in the extension manager application.

The Online Extensions i am using here:

1. dash-to-panel@jderose9.github.com
2. clipboard-indicator@tudmotu.com
3. notification-banner-reloaded@marcinjakubowski.github.com
4. HideItems@fablevi.github.io
